# Port-Scanner
Simple Python-based TCP port scanner built as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.
# Simple Python Port Scanner 🚀

This is a beginner-friendly port scanner written in Python.  
It allows the user to input an IP address and a list of custom ports to scan.  
It also includes a list of default common ports for quick scanning.

---

## 💻 How It Works
- The user enters an IP address.
- The user chooses specific ports OR defaults to a common port list.
- The script attempts TCP connections and reports which ports are open.

---

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced
- Python scripting
- TCP networking
- User input handling
- Problem-solving process

---

## 🧠 Reflection
This project helped me practice basic network scanning concepts and user interaction with scripts.  
It also taught me about error handling and improving script usability for others.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add multithreading for faster scans
- Add a basic service banner grabber
- Allow hostname (not just IP address) inputs
